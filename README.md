## About me

My name is Robert Colley and I am excited about using cutting edge technology to create platforms and solutions to solve the world's problems. I am passionate about React Native and mobile app development and open sources development. Most of my work is done in private repositories with my other GitHub account for work, but I would be happy to discuss my experiences and knowlege.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

About Unity and developing with my brother [Joe](https://github.com/JoeThCo). I'm learning unity for work as well in the context of VR/AR applications.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on...

more open source projects I'm interested in. I'm very interested in how React Native operates with Native code and the libraries which are available to native iOS or android developers which may be bridged to the react native world.

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with...

Finding a technical mentor. I've been working with a startup and being forced to learn everything myself and figure everything out myself. I am proud of the work I've done, but I think the guidance of an older mentor on the product development front of the software architecture front would be greatly appreciated.
